# Introduction
This repository contains my project for the Programming for Data Analysis module which forms part of the ATU Galway HDIP in Data Analytics.   
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook on the research I conducted on a real world phenomenon, an investigation into each of the variables, an exploration of their relationships iwth each other, a simulated data set of the variables and a summary of my findings.


# Technical Requirements
## To download this Project
1. Go to my repository on Github at https://github.com/rebeccaf1918/Programming-for-DA
2. From there, you can choose how to use the repository whether that is downloading it as a zipfile or cloning the repository.  

## Requirements to run the code
This code is written in Python programming language and there are a few requirments necessary for the operate of the project code.
1. Install Python - latest version 3.11.0 (I recommend to install Anaconda with it for expanded programming   capabilities)
2. Install the Visual Studio Code (or your source code editor of preference)  
3. Install Cmder (or your command line interpreter of preference)  
4. Install all the Python libraries required  

  
## Requirements & Instructions  
In order to begin my analysis of the data set, I began by importing the libraries I would need to view and manipulate the data:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a very useful library for analysing and manipulating data and making a dataset readable.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used for creating visualisations in Python from boxplots to scatterplots. 
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) is short for 'Numerical Python' and is useful when working with number arrays.
- [Sys](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sys-module/) has many helpful features which assist in creating Python code such as facilitating command line arguments to be passed to a script.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction) is built on top of Matplotlib and is used for creating statisical visualisations, with added features.

# Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
# collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
# Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
# Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
# Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

    "The recidivism rate of of those released from incarceration is an issue which arises again and again. As the population of Ireland continues to grow, this can place pressure on many resources, prison capacity included. Thus, many people look at the goal of incarceration itself, and whether it is fit for purpose.\n",
    "When considering the purpose of incarceration, the main theories that underpin incarceration are: Incapacitation, rehabilitation, reparation, deterrence and retribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, looking at the theories of deterrence and rehabilitation, the issue of recidivism is particularly relevant. If the incarceration of wrong-doers is based on the notion that prison will rehabilitate them, reforming their behaviour and providing educational and emotional support, then the rate of recidivism can demonstrate whether rehabilitation is acutally being achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if prison is considered a deterrent to would-be criminals, then the rate of recidivism can demonstrate if this is being achieved. A higher rate of recidivism can demonstrate that imprisonment is not an effective deterrent to criminals. \n",

In particular, there are various factors such as relationship breakdowns, mental health issues, and traumatic events and difficult upbringings can all contirbute significantly to the rate of recidivism of a particular offender. However, such variables are difficult to accurately measure and are greatly influenced by the personal experiences and motivations of each individual. "

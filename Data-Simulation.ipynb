I will investigate the risk factors for reoffending within 1 year of release from incarceration. To do this, I will focus on key variables, I will research each of these variables and explore their relationship and any possible correlations. \n",

    "The recidivism rate of of those released from incarceration is an issue which arises again and again. As the population of Ireland continues to grow, this can place pressure on many resources, prison capacity included. Thus, many people look at the goal of incarceration itself, and whether it is fit for purpose or if there could be an alternative to incarceration.\n",
    "When considering the purpose of incarceration, the main theories that underpin incarceration are: Incapacitation, rehabilitation, reparation, deterrence and retribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, looking at the theories of deterrence and rehabilitation, the issue of recidivism is particularly relevant. If the incarceration of wrong-doers is based on the notion that prison will rehabilitate them, reforming their behaviour and providing educational and emotional support, then the rate of recidivism can show whether rehabilitation is acutally being achieved. High rates of recidivism can demonstrate that imprisonment is not successful in reforming criminals into law-abiding members of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if prison is considered a deterrent to would-be criminals, then the rate of recidivism can demonstrate if this is being achieved. A higher rate of recidivism can demonstrate that imprisonment is not an effective deterrent to criminals. \n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to simulate a dataset. Due to the large amount of data easily accessible online, this raises the question: why create a simulated dataset instead of just using data already available? \n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage to using simulated data is that it allows machine learning, deep learning and other analysis to be conducted on synthesised data, which is especially helpful when the collection of real world data may be too costly or too time consuming to conduct. It also facilitates the exploration of alternative outcomes to potential situations by creating various synthesised data sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "With regard to the issue of reoffending of Irish prisoners, a simulated data set can be useful for predicting which prisoners are at a greater risk of reoffending. This allows Government agencies, prisons, police, and other relevant organisations to alter the current system to reduce the likelihood of reoffending for those most at risk. It also allows them to examine any processes which are not working effectively and as the data has been synthesised, any potential changes could also be simulated to predict the success of such changes."

    "\n",
    "The recidivism rate of criminals is a very complex issue. It is not within the remit of this project to comprehensively cover all of the factors which contribute to the recidivism of criminals. In particular, there are various factors such as relationship breakdowns, mental health issues, and traumatic events and difficult upbringings which can all contirbute significantly to the rate of recidivism of individual offenders. However, such variables are difficult to accurately measure and are greatly influenced by the personal experiences and motivations of each individual. \n",

    "This data, espeically when the data was in age brackets and general categories, did not lend itself easily to analysing the data and drawing any correlations. \n",
    "For example, when using the df.describe() function, due to the nature of the categorical data, I was unable to get the standard deviation, mean, percentile etc. Furthermore, I was unable to get the distribution of the data using numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform and numpy.random.randint. In hindsight, I would chose a topic with a focus on continous numerical data, for examplet the kind found in the famous Palmer Penguins dataset."
